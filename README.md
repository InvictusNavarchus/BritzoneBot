### üõ†Ô∏è Utility Commands  

These standalone commands provide general information and do not require special permissions.  

| Command      | Description                                        | Options       |

| `/ping`   | Tests the bot's responsiveness. Replies with "Pong!".       | *No options.* |

This structure makes it clear that `/breakout` commands require subcommands, while `/utility` commands do not.
