## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

Follow these straightforward steps to deploy and configure BritzoneBot on your Discord server:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/InvictusNavarchus/BritzoneBot.git](https://github.com/InvictusNavarchus/BritzoneBot.git)
    cd BritzoneBot
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:

    Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Navigate to the cloned repository directory in your terminal and run:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configuration**:

    *   **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository. Add the following environment variables, replacing placeholders with your actual bot token and bot ID obtained from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications):

        ```env
        TOKEN=your-bot-token
        BOT_ID=your-bot-id
        ```

    *   **Guild List Configuration**: Create a `guildList.json` file in the root directory. This file maps your Discord server names to their respective IDs.  You'll need to retrieve your server IDs from Discord. An example `guildList.json` structure is provided below:

        ```json
        {
           "YourServerName1": "YourServerID1",
           "YourServerName2": "YourServerID2"
        }
        ```

4.  **Deployment**:

    *   **Local Command Deployment**: To register the bot's commands within your specified Discord servers, run:

        ```sh
        node deployCommandsLocal.js
        ```
        This script will deploy the commands to the guilds listed in your `guildList.json`.

5.  **Run the Bot**:

    Start the BritzoneBot using the following command:

    ```sh
    node index.js
    ```
    Ensure your terminal remains running to keep the bot online. For production deployments, consider using process managers like `pm2` or `systemd` to ensure bot uptime and automatic restarts.
